## Run on your machine

you'll need to clone the frontend and backend to run simultaneously on different ports.

```
git clone https://github.com/brendaliu2/Jobly-Frontend.git
git clone https://github.com/brendaliu2/Jobly-Backend.git
FrontEnd: `npm start` set to port 3000
Backend: `nodemon` set to port 3001
```
